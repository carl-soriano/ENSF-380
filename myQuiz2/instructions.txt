1. Run the tests Quiz2v3Test.java.
2. Fix DisplayRecipe.java, Ingredients.java, and Recipe.java so that all tests pass. You should not modify Quiz2v3Test.java.
3. Submit the corrected files following the general submission instructions (the same instructions for assignments - see D2L).

Tip: You will need to correct some syntax errors before the tests can be run.

Tip: We will use the same tests provided in Quiz2v3Test.java to mark your code, but potentially with different testing values. Your grade will be based on the number of tests passed when run against the test file. Therefore, ALL syntax errors must be corrected to receive any points.

You may receive zero if:
- Any submitted Java file does not compile
- Your submission is in the wrong format
- You do not include the correct package declaration (edu.ucalgary.oop)
- You do not submit all required files: DisplayRecipe.java, Ingredients.java, and Recipe.java
- You submit any files other than the required files. DO NOT SUBMIT Quiz2v3Test.java!
